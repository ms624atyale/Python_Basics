with wheat.', 'For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to

gold, and stole it.', 'The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations.', 'A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, \"\"Pray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there.', 'It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.\"\"', '\"\\n\"A Lion, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice.',

the Lion devoured them.', 'After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful distance,

the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm.', \"He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could.\", 'He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.', 'He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his

is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me.', 'If you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together.\"\"', 'The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her voice, eagerly flew up.', 'The Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to death. \"', '\"The beasts of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which the Monkey stood up and danced.', 'Having vastly delighted the assembly, he sat down amidst universal applause.', 'The Camel, envious of the praises bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to divert to himself the favor of the guests, proposed to stand up in his turn and dance for their amusement.', 'He moved about in so utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a fit of indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the assembly.', 'It is absurd to ape our betters. \"', '\"A Peasant had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers.', 'He resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its roots.', 'The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors.', 'He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe.', 'When he reached the hollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey.', 'Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as sacred, took great care of it.', 'Self-interest alone moves some men. \"', '\"Two Soldiers traveling together were set upon by a Robber.', 'The one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his stout right hand.', 'The Robber being slain, the timid companion ran up and drew his sword, and then, throwing back his traveling cloak said, \"\"I\\'ll at him, and I\\'ll take care he shall learn whom he has attacked.\"\"', 'On this, he who had fought with the Robber made answer, \"\"I only wish that you had helped me just now, even if it had been only with those words, for I should have been the more

every part.', 'The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an intense silence.', 'He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.', 'When that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause.', 'A Countryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, \"\"So help me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!\"\"', 'and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more natural way.', 'On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman than to see the spectacle.', 'Both of the performers appeared on the stage.', 'The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators.', 'Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak.', 'The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater.', 'On this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake.', '\"\"Look here,\"\" he said, \"\"this shows what sort of judges you are.\"\"', '\"\\n\"A Crow in great want of food

after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman increased more and more the distance between them.', 'The Hunter, sorely against his will, called out to him and said, \"\"Get along with you!', 'for I will now make you a present of the hare.\"\"', '\"\\n\"A King, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion.', 'Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a lion.', 'When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: \"\"O you most detestable of animals!', \"through a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what shall I now do to you?'\", 'With these words he stretched out his hands toward a

respect is shown to old age in these days?', 'Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk?', 'Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs.\"\"', 'Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and got up himself.', 'In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children: \"\"Why, you lazy old fellow,\"\" cried several tongues at once, \"\"how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?\\'', 'The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him.',

try.\"\"', 'So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town.', 'This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river.', 'Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain. \"', '\"A troublesome Crow seated herself on the back of a Sheep.', 'The Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time, and at last said,

pricked and grievously tom the soles of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to her for assistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself.', 'The Bramble, interrupting him, said, \"\"But you really must have been out of your senses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed to fasten upon others.\"\"', '\"\\n\"A Wolf, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to his lair.', 'A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it from him.', 'Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, \"\"You have unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!\"\"', 'To which the Lion jeeringly replied, \"\"It was righteously yours, eh?', 'The gift of a friend?\\'\"', '\"A Dog, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth to its widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it to be an egg.', 'Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he said, \"\"I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything round must be an egg.\"\"', 'They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into unsuspected danger. \"', '\"An Ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning.', 'A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her.', 'The Ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank.', 'Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches.', 'The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.', 'In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove take wing. \"', '\"A Fowler caught a Partridge and was about to kill it.', 'The Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, \"\"Pray, master, permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your mercy to me.\"\"', 'The Fowler

tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the window.', 'He fell with

Elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him.', 'After a time he observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a

came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to say, \"\"I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.\"\"', 'The Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest.', 'Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned \"\"to be cast to

Panther, by some mischance, fell into a pit.', 'The Shepherds discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life.', 'At night they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him dead.', 'The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps.', 'After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury.', 'Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for

Sister had already chosen her books and was waiting at the check-out desk.  \t‚ÄúHold your horses,‚Äù said Brother. ‚ÄúI am looking for a good mystery.‚Äù \tSister Bear usually took out storybooks and books about nature‚Äìand sometimes books of poems. Brother liked those, too, but lately he‚Äôd become interested in mysteries‚Äìespecially spooky ones. \t‚ÄúHey, this one looks good,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs check out.‚Äù \t‚ÄúHmmm,‚Äù said Sister, looking at the cover. It was called The Case of the Crying Cave. ‚ÄúIt looks scary to me!‚Äù \t‚ÄúSay! This is really good!‚Äù said Brother later that evening when the Bear family had settled down for some reading. ‚ÄúWould you like me to read it to you?‚Äù he asked Sister.  \tSister was looking at a storybook about three kittens who were arguing about which was the prettiest‚Äìand it was a little boring. \t‚ÄúOr are you scared?‚Äù teased Brother.  \t‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù said Sister. She left her book on the floor and climbed onto the bench to sit beside him. \tThe mystery began quietly. It told about some bear scouts who were on an overnight camp-out. \tWhen the scouts discovered a dark, secret cave, Brother‚Äôs mystery began to get a little exciting. And when the cave began to cry and wail, it was anything but quiet! \t‚Äú‚ÄôWho-o-o-o-o! cried the deep, dark mysterious cave,‚Äô‚Äù read Brother with a lot of expression. ‚Äú‚Äô ‚ÄôWho-o-o-o-o!‚Äô‚Äù \t‚ÄúStop!‚Äù said Sister, putting her fingers in her ears. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough!‚Äù And she went back to her storybook.  \t‚ÄúScaredy bear! Scaredy bear!‚Äù teased Brother.  \t‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs quite enough of that,‚Äù added Papa Bear, looking up from his paper. \tAt the cubs‚Äô bedtime Papa and Mama said good night, turned off the light, and left the cubs in the usual sleepy darkness. \tOutside the tree house the bright, busy sounds of day had given to the soft, soothing sounds of night‚Äìthe quiet conversation of frogs and toads, the soft cry of the owl, the sigh of the night wind. And if you listened very hard, you could almost hear the softest sound of all‚Äìthe sound of lightning bugs switching their lights on and off, on and off. \tBut inside the tree house Sister Bear wasn‚Äôt even beginning to fall asleep. That night the dark didn‚Äôt seem the least bit quiet and sleepy. In fact, it seemed like the spooky darkness of a scary cave. And the friendly old chest of drawers and funny clothes tree that Papa had made didn‚Äôt seem so friendly and funny. They seemed more like cave creatures.  \tSo when brother decided to tease her a little more by making a wailing noise‚Äìa really sppoky wailing noise‚Äîit gave her quite a scare.      ‚ÄúMama! Papa!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúHurry! Come quick!‚Äù     And come quickly they did.      Papa rushed into the dark room and tripped over the clothes three.     Mama rushed in after Papa and tripped over him.     In the commotion Sister fell out of bed and landed on both of them.      Then Brother, who had started it all with his spooky wall, turned on the light. What a mess! Sister, still scared, was holding on to Papa. Papa was holding on to the toe he had stubbed. And Mama was looking for the night cap she had lost in the confusion. All three of them were pretty annoyed with Brother Bear.      It turned out to be a very long night in the Bear‚Äôs tree house. Papa and Mama tried to explain that there was nothing to be afraid of in the dark (except maybe running into a clothes tree and stubbing your toe)‚Äìbut it didn‚Äôt do any good.     Sister absolutely refused to go to sleep with the light off.     And Brother positively insisted that he couldn‚Äôt fall asleep with the light on.     The next morning the Bear family was very sleepy-eyed.      ‚ÄúBoy,‚Äù said Brother, yawning. ‚ÄúI sure don‚Äôt want to go through another night like that!‚Äù     ‚ÄúNeither do I,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúAnd I think I have an idea that might help.‚Äù     He took Sister‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù he said.     ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù she wanted to know.      ‚ÄúUp to the attic.‚Äù     ‚ÄúThe attic? But it‚Äôs dark in the attic‚Äìeven in the daytime.‚Äù     ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs something I want to show you.      Anyway, there‚Äôs nothing so special about the dark. It‚Äôs just part of nature, like the light. It‚Äôs your imagination that makes the dark seem spooky sometimes.‚Äù      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs imagination?‚Äù asked Sister.     ‚ÄúImagination is what makes us think that chests of drawers and clothes trees are cave creatures.‚Äù     ‚ÄúI wish I didn‚Äôt have one,‚Äù said Sister.     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúA lively imagination is one of the best things a cub can have. It‚Äôs imagination that lets us paint pictures, make up poems, invent inventions! The trick is to take charge of your imagination‚Äìand not let it take charge of you.‚Äù     When they got to the attic, Papa began to rummage through boxes, looking for something.     Sister tried to follow Papa‚Äôs advice and not let her imagination take charge.     And it worked‚Äìa spooky shape turned out to be the shadow of some old tools.     What looked like a giant was really some piled-up furniture.     ‚ÄúHere it is!‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúMy old night light! The one I used when I was a cub and had a little trouble falling asleep in the dark!‚Äù      Sister couldn‚Äôt quite believe that her big, powerful papa was ever afraid of the dark.      ‚ÄúOh, sure,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúMost of us are at one time or another.‚Äù     ‚ÄúHow about reading the rest of The Case of the Crying Cave?‚Äù Sister Bear asked Brother later that day.      ‚ÄúAre you sure you want me to?‚Äù     ‚ÄúSure! I want to see how it turns out!‚Äù she insisted.     When it tured out that there was nothing very spooky about the terrible wailing noise (it was caused by wind blowing across an opening in the roof of the case‚Äìlike the noise you make when you blow across the top of a bottle), Sister was a little disappointed.     And that night, when she and Brother were all settle down in the cozy glow of Papa‚Äôs old night light, she said so. ‚ÄúI was pretty disappointed by the way The Case of the Crying Cave ended.‚Äù     ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù asked Brother.      ‚ÄúBecause,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI was hoping the wailing would be a really spooky, scary monster!‚Äù And she leaned down from her bunk over Brother‚Äôs and made a spooky, scary monster face at him.     ‚ÄúCut that out!‚Äù cried Brother.     Then Sister went right to sleep.     But Brother lay awake for quite some time listening to the owl hoots and thinking that maybe he‚Äôd had enough mysteries for a while.            included in images: bear country library out, mysteries, cubs corner THE CASE OF THE CRYING CAVE WOOOOO BEAR COUNTRY GARDENS THE CASE OF THE CRYING THE CASE OF THE CRYING CAVE WOOOOO ‚ÄúA mysterious cave!‚Äù said the bear scouts. ‚ÄúWe should explore it!‚Äù But before the scouts could go into the cave a wailing sound came from the cave.  WHOO-O-O-O It was a strange sound and it frightened the scouts. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù they cried. O-O-O-O-O WHO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O ‚ÄúThe mystery is solved!‚Äù shouted Bear Scout Ted looking down from the hole in the top of the crying cave. The sounds are made by the wind.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand!‚Äù said Bear scout Fred.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you!‚Äù said Bear Scout Ted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like when you blow across the top of a bottle.‚Äù  WHO-O-O-O-O-O-O   1984 The Berenstain Bears and MAMA‚Äôs NEW JOB STAN and JAN BERENSTAIN      The Bear family, who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country, was a very happy family. One of the reasons was that they were all very busy. Each member of the family had work to do. Papa Bear cut and split logs and made the wood into handsome furniture which he was proud to sell.      Mama Bear not only took care of her family, but she managed the whole tree house and tended the vegetable patch as well.      And, of course, Brother and Sister Bear had important jobs too: going to school and keeping up with their schoolwork.      The members of the Bear family had hobbies, too. Papa‚Äôs favorite hobbies were fishing and napping. He caught almost as many naps as he caught fish. Brother and Sister also had many hobbies. Brother was especially proud of his model airplanes. He liked to have Mama watch him fly his models, and sometimes she helped him fly his tether plane.     Sister was a super rope-jumper and her goal was to jump a thousand times without a miss. She liked to have Mama count for her because Sister could jump faster than she could count.      Since Mama was so busy with her household duties, she had time for just one hobby‚Äìbut what a hobby! Mama was the best quilt maker in all of Bear Country! Her quilts were light and fluffy, but very warm. Her stitchery was fine and even. And her designs were original and exciting.      Sister Bear slept cozy and warm under a quilt that showed her jumping rope. Brother went to sleep under a handsome airplane design. And the big quilt on Mama and Papa‚Äôs bed showed the Bear family‚Äôs beautiful tree house.      Yes, the members of the Bear family had happy, busy, full lives. Especially Mama.      ‚ÄúMy dear,‚Äù called Papa to Mama as she worked in the vegetable patch, ‚Äúif it wouldn‚Äôt be too much trouble, would you put aside any fishing worms you might find?‚Äù     ‚ÄúLook, Mama!‚Äù called Brother. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fly my new biplane!‚Äù     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to try for a thousand, Mama!‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúWould you please count for me?‚Äù     A little too full, thought Mama from time to time. She would have liked to have a little more time for her quilts. She had some lovely design ideas she wanted to try: a sunburst with clouds and bluebirds... a beautiful bouquet of flowers with butterflies... and a harvest scene with pumpkins and squash. But there just never seemed to be enough time.      Then one day something happed that changed the lives of the Bear family‚Äìsomething that changed Mama‚Äôs quilt-making from a hobby... into a business!     It might not have happened except for a coincidence, which is when two things happen at the same time.     The two things that happened were that Papa had a big sale of some very special furniture, and on the same day Mam hung out the family quilts to air.     Folks who came to buy Papa‚Äôs handsome furniture became excited about Mama‚Äôs beautiful quilts and wanted to buy them, too. Would-be buyers offered Mama quite a lot of money. They were very disappointed when she told them that the quilts were not for sale.      ‚ÄúWith your talent, you really should be in business!‚Äù they said.      ‚ÄúMama in business?‚Äù said Papa, patting her on the shoulder. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. One business-bear in the family is enough.‚Äù     But Mama wasn‚Äôt so sure. She was proud of her quilt-making skills and knowledge. After all, she was president of the Bear Country Quilting Club. Other quilt makers often came to her for help and advice.      That evening Papa and the cubs noticed that Mama was very quiet. She was quiet during supper. She was quiet during cleanup. She was quiet all evening. She was quiet because she was thinking‚Äìthinking about going into business.     The next day at lunch she made her big announcement.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to open up a quilt shop.‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôve rented the empty store just down the road.‚Äù     ‚ÄúNot that overgrown wreck that‚Äôs been empty for years!‚Äù protested Papa.      ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt want to be a business-bear,‚Äù said Sister. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre our mama!‚Äù     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no reason why I shouldn‚Äôt open my own quilt shop. A lot of mama bears have jobs: Mrs. Grizzle is a sister; Mrs. Honeybear teaches school; Dr. Gert grizzly is your pediatrician...‚Äù     ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said Brother, ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre not our mama!‚Äù     ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really nothing to worry about,‚Äù said Mama.      ‚ÄúThings aren‚Äôt going to be all that different.‚Äù     ‚ÄúWill you still count for me when I jump rope?‚Äù asked Sister.     ‚ÄúAnd will you still watch my fly my airplanes?‚Äù Brother wanted to know.      ‚ÄúAnd how about my fishing worms?‚Äù asked Papa. ‚ÄúWill you still put them aside for me when you tend the vegetable patch?‚Äù     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about all that,‚Äù Mama said. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, I have to be at the shop. Some of my quilt club friends are helping me get it ready‚Äìand, oh yes,‚Äù she added as she turned to leave, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot to do, so supper may be a little late tonight. Ta-ta!‚Äù     ‚ÄúTa-ta!‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúTa-ta!‚Äù said the cubs.     Supper wasn‚Äôt a little late that night. It was a lot late‚Äìand it was Papa and the cubs who prepared it. But they didn‚Äôt mind, because although Mama was very tired, she was very happy, too‚Äìhappy and excited!           ‚ÄúGuess what!‚Äù said Sister as she served Mama her supper. ‚ÄúI reached a thousand jumps today! Brother counted for me!‚Äù     ‚ÄúAnd Sis helped me fly my tether plane! We had a great flight!‚Äù added Brother.     ‚ÄúAnd I weeded the vegetable patch,‚Äù said Papa, bringing a tub of warm water to Mama for her tired feet.      ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very proud of you all.‚Äù     Papa and the cubs were very proud of her, too. There was no way to tell whether the quilt shop would be a success, but she certainly was giving it a good try.     After about two weeks of hard work, the Bear Country Quilt Shop had its grand opening. It was a very exciting event! Not only did Mama sell her own quilts, but she sold quilts for all the members of her club as well.      It was a great success. Why, even Mayor and Mrs. Honeypot came in their long lavender limousine. They bought one quilt and ordered three more.     ‚ÄúI know what!‚Äù said Mama as she closed ups shop that night. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stop off at the Burger Bear for supper! My treat!‚Äù     The Bear family celebrated with a delicious Burger Bear supper. Papa and the cubs were very proud of their business-bear wife and mama.     The extra money came in handy too!

First there had been nursery school, which was pure fun‚Äìplaying with dolls and blocks, rolling clay snakes, and scribbling with crayons.     Next had come kindergarten. That was fun too. There were marching games and rhythm band. She also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten‚Äìand most of the alphabet. Now Sister was in first grade. Regular school was different. It was still fun and she liked Teacher Jane very much, but it wasn‚Äôt all fun. There was quite a lot of work‚Äìspelling, number problems, all kinds of things.     In regular school you have to concentrate‚Äìand sometimes when you concentrate, you form little nervous habits. That‚Äôs what happened to some of the cubs in Teacher Jane‚Äôs class. Lizzy twirled her fur. Twirl, twirl, twirl. Freddy scratched his head. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Norman sucked his thumb. Suck, suck, suck. And Sister nibbled her nails. Nibble, nibble, nibble, nibble.     Before she knew it, she had nibbled them down to nubbins. In fact, she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore.      ‚ÄúOh, dear!‚Äù said Mama Bear to Sister when the cubs got home from school one day. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve nibbled yur nails down to nubbins. In fact, you‚Äôve nibbled them cleaned off. How did it happen?‚Äù     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly sure, Mama,‚Äù Sister said. ‚ÄúBut some of them are getting sore.‚Äù     ‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do. We‚Äôll put a little medicine on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them. That will remind you not to nibble and will give them a change to grow back‚Äù     The bits of tape helped Sister remember not to nibble, but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things. It‚Äôs very hard to hole a pencil with tape all over your fingertips, or tune the TV, or scratch when you have an itch.     But worst of all, the bits of tape told the whole orld that Sister Bear was a nail biter.     The next morning, when sister lined up for school, Lizzy Bruin and some others began pointing and teasing. ‚ÄúSister nibbles her nails! Sister nibbles her nails!‚Äù It didn‚Äôt take Sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape!     And without the tape, she forgot to remember not to nibble. She forgot during school. She forgot on the bus. She even forgot as she and Brother climbed off the bus.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to cut that out, Sis,‚Äù said Brother, ‚Äúor you‚Äôll get to e a regular full-time nail biter.‚Äù     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid your brother‚Äôs right,‚Äù said Mama, who was organizing the wheelbarrow for some garden work. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to ng, but nail biting is a very difficult habit to break.‚Äù      ‚ÄúHabit?‚Äù asked Sister, making fists so that her nubby, nibbled-off nails wouldn‚Äôt show. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a habit?‚Äù     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good question,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúCome along while I plant these tulip bulbs Grizzly Gran sent over and we‚Äôll talk about it.      ‚ÄúA habit,‚Äù Mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well-worn path, ‚Äúis something you do so often you don‚Äôt even have to think about it. Habits are a very important part of our lives. And most of them are good‚Äìlike brushing your teeh and combing your fur when you get up in the morning, and looking both ways before you cross a road. But some habits aren‚Äôt so good.‚Äù     ‚ÄúLike nail biting?‚Äù asked Sister.     ‚ÄúYou would like to have your nice nails grow back, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù as Mama‚Äôs answer.     ‚ÄúOh, yes!‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúBut I keep forgetting! Why is it so hard to remember?‚Äù     ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Mama, ‚Äúit‚Äôs sort of like this path. I‚Äôve wheeled this barrow over it so many times that it‚Äôs worn a deep rut right down the middle. And it keeps getting deeper every time I use it. Why, it‚Äôs so deep now that I can‚Äôt get out of it without a little help.‚Äù     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it is with a bad habit‚Äìthe more you use it, the harder it is to get out of it. Here, this is where I want to plant the bulbs.‚Äù     ‚ÄúWhat about my nail-biting habit?‚Äù asked Sister as she helped Mama out of the deep rut. ‚ÄúHow am I going to get out of it?‚Äù     ‚ÄúYou just need a little help, that‚Äôs all,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs lant Gran‚Äôs tulips while I think about it. And later I‚Äôll talk to your papa. He may have some ideas.‚Äù ‚ÄúI could read the riot act to her,‚Äù suggested Papa. ‚ÄúYou know: ‚ÄòNail biting is an outrageous, disgraceful habit and if you don‚Äôt stop it immediately‚Äì‚Äò‚Äù     ‚ÄúDear me, no!‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúNail biting is a kind of nervous habit, and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous.‚Äù ‚ÄúI suppose so,‚Äù said Papa thoughtfully. ‚ÄúPerhaps some sort of reward would help. A bit of money‚ÄìLet‚Äôs say a dime for every day she doesn‚Äôt bite her nails.‚Äù Before Mama could answer, Sister Bear, who had been nervously nibbling in the next room, popped in and said, ‚ÄúA dime‚Äìten whole cents every day just for not biting my nails?‚Äù  \t‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúUntil the habit‚Äôs broken.‚Äù     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never nibble again!‚Äù she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get.     But the way it turned out, she didn‚Äôt get a single dime. All she got was discouraged.  A day is a long time and habits are powerful‚Äìespecially bad habits. Even with the promise of a dime, Sister couldn‚Äôt remember not to nibble. Mama and Papa got discouraged too. \t‚ÄúOh, well,‚Äù sighed Mama. ‚ÄúLife goes on. I must call Gran and thank her for the tulip bulbs.‚Äù \t‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre very welcome, my dear,‚Äù said Gran when Mama called. ‚ÄúAnd how is everything at your house?...Is that so?...You know, I was a nail biter when I was a cub and my mama helped me to stop. What have you tried so far?... Um...Uh-huh...Well, I think you‚Äôre on the right track with the dime, but instead of a dime, and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day...‚Äù \t‚ÄúWhat an interesting idea,‚Äù said Mama as she listened to wise old Grizzly Gran. \tSo they tried Gran‚Äôs idea. Instead of a dime at the end of each day, they gave Sister ten pennies‚Äìone for each nail‚Äìat the beginning of each day. Ten pennies to keep‚Äìunless she nibbled. \tAnd with those pennies in her pocket, jiggling when she got on the school bus, jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyard...just waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed a nibble...the plan worked!     Not perfectly. It‚Äôs hard to break a habit, and Sister had to give back some of those pennies. But in ten days she had ninety-three pennies!     But even better: she had ten fine fingernails. Great for picking things up, turning the TV, and scratching itches.     And the next time she played jacks she got all the way to tensies!     ‚ÄúPhew!‚Äù said Papa Bear. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs over.‚Äù      ‚ÄúYes, indeed!‚Äù agreed Mama, breathing a great sigh of relief. That‚Äôs when Brother Bear looked at his fingernails and piped up, ‚ÄúYou know, I think I might start biting my nails‚ÄìI could use the money.‚Äù ‚ÄúI certainly hope you‚Äôre joking!‚Äù roared Papa. ‚ÄúBecause if you‚Äôre not‚Äì‚Äù     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm joking. I‚Äôm joking,‚Äù interrupted Brother.      And he was‚Äìsort of.           11111 2222 3333 4444 Aa Aa Bb Bb CcCc HAT BAT CAT BALL TALL WALL UP/DOWN BIG/SMALL OUT/IN 3+4=7 3+4=7 2+5=7 2+5=7 SCHOOL BUS   1987 The Berestain Bears and the TROUBLE at SCHOOL Stan & Berenstain     Though Brother and Sister Bear were usually very healthy, they occasionally caught cold. So when Brother came home from school one day sneezing and wheezing. Mama Bear knew just what to do.      She took his temperature, tucked him into bed, and went right to the phone and called Dr. Grizzly.     ‚ÄúSneezing and wheezing and a temperature of a hundred and one?‚Äù said Dr. Grizzly. ‚ÄúKeep him in bed, give him plenty of liquids, and keep him home from school until his temperature is back to normal.‚Äù     Mama followed the doctor‚Äôs orders, and little by little Brother‚Äôs temperature began to go down.      ‚ÄúI feel a little better,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMay I get out of bed?‚Äù     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid not,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúThe doctor wants yu to stay in bed.‚Äù     ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no reason why your stay shouldn‚Äôt be as pleasant as possible...Papa!‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúWould you bring up the portable TV?‚Äù     The portable had remote control, and pretty soon Brother was having a fine time switching from one cartoon show to another.     When he tired of TV he got out his comic books, and when he tired of those, Mama brought him his dinosaur collection. There was no doubt about it‚Äìexcept for his sniffles, Brother Bear was having a pretty good time.     So when Sister Bear brought home a folder of schoolwork for him, he hardly looed at it‚Äìhe was much too busy having fun.     But while he was at home having fun, his fellow students at school were hard at work...     In the classroom, where Teacher Bob was teaching a new math lesson. They had learned to add, subtract, and multiply. Now they were learning to divide.     On the soccer field, where Coach Bruin was getting the team ready for the big game against Beartown...     ‚ÄúCousin Freddy!‚Äù he called. ‚ÄúTake Brother‚Äôs place at forward. He‚Äôs out sick.‚Äù     ‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù said Freddy. This was the chance he‚Äôd been waiting for.      It wasn‚Äôt until Brother was all better and ready to go back to school that he remembered the folder of work. ‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù he thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll study it on the bus.‚Äù     But that‚Äôs where he heard about Freddy and the soccer team. He was so upset he forgot all about studying.     When Coach Bruin had extra practice during early gym, Brother became even more upset. It wasn‚Äôt easy watching Freddy take his place on the team.     Then, when Brother got back to class, Teacher Bob said, ‚ÄúI certainly hope you studied that work folder, because we‚Äôre going to have a quiz.‚Äù     ‚ÄúA quiz?‚Äù said Brother. ‚ÄúOn what?‚Äù     ‚ÄúOn division, of course,‚Äù said Teacher Bob as he handed out the quiz papers.     Brother might have managed even then. He was good with numbers and might have worked things out if only he‚Äôd been able to concentrate. But all he could think about was Cousin Freddy out there kicking field goals while he sat on the bench.      The quiz was a disaster. Not only did Brother get every problem wrong, but Teacher Bob wrote on the paper: ‚ÄúVery poor! Must be signed by parent.‚Äù     Brother didn‚Äôt know which was worse: the soccer mess or the quiz disaster. What would he say to Mama and Papa when they asked him how things had gone at school? He was so busy feeling sorry for himself on the bus ride home that he didn‚Äôt notice that Sister was coming down with a bad case of the sneezes and wheezes.     ‚ÄúOh, dear!‚Äù said Mama when she saw Sister. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve caught Brother‚Äôs cold. Into bed with you!‚Äù She and Papa were so busy attending to Sister that they forgot to ask Brother how things went at school...and he didn‚Äôt tell them!     And the next morning, when the school bus came, Brother didn‚Äôt get on the bus! He hid in the tall grass until the bus was out of sight. The squirrels and bluebirds were puzzled‚ÄìBrother was usually happy and cheerful. But not this morning. This morning he looked unhappy‚Äìand angry, too.     ‚ÄúPhooey!‚Äù Brother shouted, kicking a stone. But kicking the stone reminded him of soccer and that just made him angrier. The bluebirds took off and the squirrels scattered.     ‚ÄúPhooey on soccer!‚Äù he shouted, stomping off through the woods. Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Grasshoppers hopped. Toads stood stock-still and pretended they were bumps on a log.     ‚ÄúPhooey on school!‚Äù Brother shouted, stomping out of the woods. Pansies hid their faces. Ladybugs flew away home.      ‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù he said, reaching into his schoolbag, ‚Äúphooey on division!‚Äù     He had come to the top of a big hill. He took out the quiz, folded it into a paper airplane, and sailed it high into the air. The hill overlooked a swampy, overgrown bog. As Brother watched the quiz circle and swoop he noticed something out of the corner of his eye‚Äìa familiar house at the edge of the bog.     Grizzly Gramps was working on a ship model when he heard the knock. Gran was making cookies. They weren‚Äôt expecting visitors and they certainly weren‚Äôt expecting Brother‚Äìespecially during school hours.     It didn‚Äôt take long for the whole story to come out. Gramps and Gran listened quietly as Brother told them about catching cold, the folder of work, the soccer mess, the quiz disaster, the missed bus, and the paper airplane.      ‚ÄúCome with me, young feller,‚Äù said Gramps. ‚ÄúI want to show you something.‚Äù     Gramps took Brother by the hand and led him deep into the bog.     ‚ÄúThere!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I want to show you.‚Äù     It was a very old wagon sunk almost out of sight in a muddy pond.      ‚ÄúHow did it get there?‚Äù asked Brother.     ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt easy,‚Äù said Gramps. ‚ÄúI went to a lot of trouble getting that old wagon into this swamp.‚Äù Then, with a twinkle in his eye, he said, ‚ÄúJust the way you did getting in over your head at school!     ‚ÄúIt happed a long time ago when I took a wrong turn‚Äìjust the way you did when you didn‚Äôt study that schoolwork that Teacher Bob sent home. Well, instead of admitting my mistake and backing up, I just pushed ahead until I was in so deep there was no getting out.‚Äù     ‚ÄúAnd you lost the wagon,‚Äù said Brother.     ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù said Gramps. ‚ÄúBut I learned a valuable lesson. If you find yourself on the wrong road, don‚Äôt just keep on going until you‚Äôre in over your head‚Äìback up and start over on the right road.‚Äù     ‚ÄúHow am I going to do that?‚Äù asked Brother.     ‚ÄúOh, I think we can manage‚Äìbut first, look over there,‚Äù Gramps said, pointing. There it was: the paper airplane‚Äìcaught in a berry bush.     ‚ÄúWhat do you think they‚Äôll say?‚Äù asked Brother later as they bounced along in Gramps‚Äôs pickup.      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find out soon enough,‚Äù said Gramps, pulling to a stop in front of the big tree house. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget Gran‚Äôs bag of cookies. They‚Äôre her finest.‚Äù     Mama and Papa weren‚Äôt exactly pleased when they heard about the big mess Brother had gotten himself into. But they didn‚Äôt holler and pound the table, either‚Äìnot even Papa. He looked like he might be going to when he saw the paper he had to sign‚ÄìGramps had tried to flatten it out but it was still pretty wrinkled.     ‚ÄúWhat happened to this? he asked.     ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Gramps. ‚ÄúIt just sort of got folded a bit.‚Äù That‚Äôs when he brought out Gran‚Äôs cookies. There were ten of them. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see, now,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthere are five of us counting Sister. So how many cookies do we each get?‚Äù     ‚ÄúTwo, of course,‚Äù said Brother, dividing them up.     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look now, young feller,‚Äù said Gramps with a wink, ‚Äúbut you just divided then by five!‚Äù     ‚ÄúIs that all there is to dividing?‚Äù said Brother.     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all,‚Äù said Gramps.     ‚ÄúCome along,‚Äù said Mama in a no-nonsense voice.     ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù asked Brother.     ‚ÄúTo school,‚Äù Mama said as they got in the car.     ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs so late,‚Äù protested Brother.     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never too late to correct a mistake,‚Äù Mama said, and of they went.     Brother got to class jsut in time for a retest. The class hadn‚Äôt done very well on the division quiz, so Teacher Bob was giving them a second chance.      Brother really concentrated and did much better.     And that afternoon he got a second chance at soccer, too. It was the day of the big game against Beartown and things weren‚Äôt going very well.     ‚ÄúBrother,‚Äù said Coach Bruin, ‚ÄúI want you to go in for Freddy. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs quite ready for first team.‚Äù     ‚ÄúGlad to help, Coach,‚Äù Brother said as he ran out onto the field. ‚ÄúYou know what they say‚Äìit‚Äôs never too late to correct a mistake.‚Äù           ‚Äìa AH-CHOO DIPLOMA DR.

Space Grizzlies were little toy action figures that you could collect.      Sister Bear didn‚Äôt like them much. She thought they were dumb (and a little scary).     Mama Bear didn‚Äôt mind them except when Brother brought them to the table or left them on the stairs.     Papa Bear didn‚Äôt care about them one way or the other.      But Brother cared about them a lot. He cared about them so much that he did chores for neighbors to make extra money so he coul buy more.      He had quite a few. But the store had more. A lot more. He was saving up to buy Sleezo‚Äôs Cloud Castle. Sleezo was the evilest of all the Space Grizzlies, and the wicked-looking Cloud Castle was where he planned all his evil deeds.      When Brother had saved enough money, he went along on a shopping trip to the Bear Country Mall and made his purchase. The Cloud Castle came in a big box, and he could hardly wait to get home to play with it. But as he was getting into the car, he saw something that was even more exciting than the Cloud Castle.     It was a movie poster. It said: COMING SOON. SPACE GRIZZLIES‚ÄìTHE MOVIE!     ‚ÄúA Space Grizzlies movie!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúIt looks great! I can‚Äôt wait to see it!‚Äù      ‚ÄúI can,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúLooks scary to me.‚Äù      ‚ÄúMay I see it when it comes, Mama?‚Äù asked Brother. ‚ÄúMay I, please?‚Äù     ‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see when the time comes.‚Äù     When they got home, Brother opened his new Cloud Castle, got out all his Space Grizzlies, and was all set to play the biggest Space Grizzly game ever. But... he had nobody to play with. Nobody, that is, except Sister.     ‚ÄúWant to play Space Grizzlies, Sis?‚Äù he asked.     ‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù she said.     ‚ÄúAw, come on,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play any game you want if you‚Äôll play Space Grizzlies with me.‚Äù     ‚ÄúAny three games,‚Äù she said driving a hard bargain.      ‚ÄúWhich three?‚Äù he asked warily.      ‚ÄúPapa dolls, jacks, and beanbags,‚Äù she answered.     ‚ÄúPapa dolls, jacks, and beanbags!‚Äù he protested. ‚ÄúGive me a break!‚Äù     ‚ÄúTake it or leave it,‚Äù she said. He took it. And after some lively sessions of paper dolls, jacks, and beanbags, it was time for...‚ÄìSPACE GRIZZLIES!     ‚ÄúI am Sleezo, evil king of the universe! roared Brother. ‚ÄúCalling all spaceships! Seek and destory the planet Magongo, home of my sworn enemy, Heero the Magnificent!‚Äù     ‚ÄúOh, no, you don‚Äôt!‚Äù Sister shouted back. ‚ÄúI am Heero the Magnificent! One touch from my sleep wand and your evil ways will be ended!‚Äù     They played until Mama called them for dinner.  ‚ÄúBrother,‚Äù said Mama, ‚Äúhow many times must I tell you‚Äìno Space Grizzlers at the table!‚Äù     Papa was taking a peek at the Bear Country News. ‚ÄúBrother,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthat movie of yours starts tomorrow.‚Äù     ‚ÄúMay I see it, Mama, please?‚Äù asked Brother.     ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why not,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt been to the movies in a while.‚Äù     ‚ÄúI know why not,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs scary.‚Äù      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no problem,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúThere are lots of movies to choose from.‚Äù     He was right. The Bear Country Theater was really four movie houses in one, and there were usually four different movies playing.      ‚ÄúThis looks good,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúThe Magic Toeshoes. It‚Äôs a musical about a ballerina.‚Äù     So when they got to the movies to the next evening. Mama, Papa, and Sister got in line for The Magic Toeshoes, and Brother joined a bunch of his friends in line for Space Grizzlies.     The Magic Toeshoes told the story of a young bear who wanted to e a ballerina. But every time she tried to dance on her toes she wiggled and wobbled. The old ballet master took pity on her and gave her a pair of magic toeshoes which cured her wiggles and wobbles.               But on the night of the big ballet, she left her magic toeshoes on the bus! Without them she was all wiggles and wobbles again. That‚Äôs when the ballet master told her they weren‚Äôt magic at all! They were just ordinary toeshoes. The wobbly ballerina got her confidence back and danced beautifully ever after.     The Space Grizzly movie was about Space Grizzlies, of course: great monstrous big-screen ones who zapped and zoomed through space until that final intergalactic shootout. It was very exciting and not a little scary.     It was dark when the Bear family got home, so it was off to be for the cubs. It was already late for Sister, and she went right to sleep. But Brother was so excited by the movie that he lay awake for quite a while. He was just about to doze off when Sister woke up screaming.      ‚ÄúHel-lp!‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre after me!‚Äù     ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs after you? asked Brother.     ‚ÄúSpace Grizzlies!‚Äù she wailed. ‚ÄúThousands of them!‚Äù     ‚ÄúCalm down, sillyhead. It‚Äôs only a dream,‚Äù he said.     But Sister leaped out of bed and ran into Mama and Papa‚Äôs room.      The little silly, Brother thought. Imagine‚Äìbeing afraid of a dopey dream. Then he yawned, turned over, and went to sleep.     Mama and Papa tried to calm Sister. They took her into their bed and hugged her.     ‚ÄúTell us about your dream,‚Äù said Mama.      ‚ÄúDream?‚Äù Sister said.     ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúYou must have had a nightmare. That‚Äôs the word for a bad dream.‚Äù     ‚ÄúBut it was so real!‚Äù she said, calming down a bit.      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it is with dreams,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúit‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre really happening, but they‚Äôre not‚Äìthey‚Äôre just in your mind.‚Äù     ‚ÄúCan yu tell us your ream? asked Mama.      ‚ÄúIt was awful!‚Äù Sister said. ‚ÄúI was a ballet star dancing on my toes, and then the stage turned into a giant beanbag board and the Space Grizzlies came out of the beanbag holes and chased me and I fell down one of the holes.‚Äù     ‚ÄúI kept falling and falling and then I woke up. It was awful!‚Äù she sailed again, and buried her face in Mama‚Äôs nightgown.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it was, sweetie,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúBut it was also very interesting.‚Äù     ‚ÄúInteresting?‚Äù Sister said in a puzzled voice.     ‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù said Mama. ‚Äúyou see, even though you go to sleep, your mind keeps right on thinking. But it doesn‚Äôt think in a sensible way. It takes all the things you were thinking or were nervous about during the day and puts them together all jumbled like a mixed-up zigsaw puzzle.‚Äù     ‚ÄúYou mean‚Äìlike the ballet dancer from the movie?‚Äù said Sister.     ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Papa.     ‚ÄúAnd the beanbag board from playing beanbags with Brother‚Äì‚Äù she added.     ‚ÄúAnd the Space Grizzlies‚Äì‚Äù began Mama.     ‚ÄúWhere from playing Space Grizzlies with Brother and from seeing the movie poster!‚Äù Sister said.     ‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù said Papa.      ‚ÄúSay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is interesting!‚Äù     That‚Äôs when they heard Brother.     ‚ÄúHel-l-lp!‚Äù he screamed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre after me! They‚Äôre after me!‚Äù Then he raced into the room, jumped into the bed, and hid his face in Papa‚Äôs pajamas.     ‚ÄúCalm down, son‚Äù said Papa. ‚ÄúIt was just a bad dream.‚Äù     ‚ÄúA nightmare,‚Äù added Sister. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another word for bad dream.‚Äù     ‚ÄúCan you tell us about it?‚Äù asked Mama.     ‚ÄúWell, I was eating dinner and the food turned into Space Grizzlies‚Äìgigantic ones, and they chased me and I turned into a paper doll and my clothes were flying off! It was awful!‚Äù     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake now, dear,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs going to be all right.‚Äù     ‚ÄúBut Mama,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit was so real.‚Äù     ‚ÄúOf course it was,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way dreams are. Let me explain it to you.‚Äù     And she did.             Some dreams make cubs laugh. Some dreams make them cry. It‚Äôs interesting to think about what they dream and why. SPACE GRIZZLIES HEADQUARTERS TOYS BEAR COUNTRY BARN THEATER COMING SOON SPACE GRIZZLIES THE MOVIE SPACE DOOR BUT STOP  1994 The Berenstain Bears and the BULLY      One day, Mama, Papa, and Brother Bear were busy in the yard when Sister Bear came home crying. Her face was scratched and dirty, and her clothes were torn. ‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù asked Mama.     ‚ÄúPlease tell us,‚Äù said Papa.     Brother couldn‚Äôt believe how beat-up Sister looked. Her jumper and blouse were turn. Her face and fur were a mess. Even her pink bow was drooping.     ‚ÄúDid you fall?‚Äù asked Mama. Sister shook her head no.      ‚ÄúWas there an accident?‚Äù asked Papa. Once again she shook her head no.      ‚ÄúI think I can tell you what happened,‚Äù said Brother. ‚ÄúIt looks to me like somebody beat her up.‚Äù     ‚ÄúBeat her up? That‚Äôs outrageous!‚Äù said Papa.     ‚ÄúWho in the world would beat up a sweet little cub like Sister?‚Äù asked Mama.     ‚ÄúA bully might,‚Äù said Brother.     That‚Äôs when Sister stopped crying long enough to get some words out. ‚ÄúB-B-Brother‚Äôs right,‚Äù she sobbed. ‚ÄúA no-good nasty rotten bully beat me up‚Äìand for no reason!‚Äù Just the thought of it made her so angry that she started to cry all over again.     Mama and Papa helped Sister up the steps and into the house. After a drink of water, she calmed down enough to tell them what had happened.      ‚ÄúLizzy, Queenie, and I were playing tag at the playground when this new cub‚Äìa no-good bully named Tuffy‚Äìstuck out a foot and tripped me. So I got up and said, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you watch where you put your fee?‚Äù Before I knew what was happening, it was POW, BAM, WHAMMO, and I was flat on my back with this Tuffy character sitting on my chest rubbing dirt in my face.‚Äù     ‚ÄúOutrageous!‚Äù roared Papa. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my hat? I‚Äôm going over to that playground and‚Äì‚Äú Mama pulled Papa aside.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to do no such thing,‚Äù she said.     ‚ÄúBut something has to be done,‚Äù Papa said.     ‚ÄúIndeed, it does,‚Äù agreed Mama. ‚ÄúBut right now we have to take care of Sister.‚Äù She turned to call, ‚ÄúBrother! Would you please get me a wet washclo‚ÄìWhere‚Äôs Brother?‚Äù     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúHe was here one minute, and the next minute he was gone.‚Äù     Lizzy and Queenie were still at the playground when Brother got there. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a knuckle sandwich for some bully named Tuffy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù     ‚ÄúBrother,‚Äù said Lizzy, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something you ought to‚Äì‚Äú     ‚ÄúNever mind the small talk,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúJust point him out and get out of the way!‚Äù     Lizzy shrugged and pointed to the small building that housed the Boy‚Äôs Room and the Girls‚Äô Room.     But there was no one there. No one, that is, but a little girl who was coming out of the Girls‚Äô Room.     But hold everything! The little girl was wearing a T-shirt that said Tuffy!     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Tuffy?‚Äù said Brother.     ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWanna make somethin‚Äô out of it?‚Äù     ‚ÄúBut‚Äìbut you‚Äôre a girl!‚Äù said Brother.     ‚ÄúWhat did you expect me to be‚Äìan eggplant?‚Äù said Tuffy.     Brother Bear was shocked right down to his very bones. This big bully he was going to clean up the playground with was not only a girl, but a little girl at that. Maybe even a bit smaller than Sister.     When Lizzy and Queenie came over to watch, Tuffy figure out who Brother was. ‚ÄúHey! said she. ‚ÄúYou must be the big brother of Little Miss Pink hairbow! She got fresh, so I cleaned her clock. Wanna make somethin‚Äô out of it?‚Äù     That was exactly what Brother wanted to do. But there was no way he could hit a girl. If he did, then he‚Äôd be the bully. It was all he could do to turn away and leave.     ‚ÄúChicken! Just like your sister!‚Äù yelled Tuffy. Brother headed home, hands in pockets, staring at the ground.     Something had to be done! But what? As he passed the school, Brother got an idea. But he would have to hurry. It was Friday afternoon, and the school would be closing for the weekend. He hoped Mr. Grizzmeyer, the gym teacher, hadn‚Äôt left yet.     When Brother got home, he was carrying something in a big bag.      Instead of going in the front door, he quietly opened the side hatch and dropped the bag into the cellar. Then he closed the hatch and rejoined the family by going in the front door.      ‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù asked Mama. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having a family meeting.‚Äù      ‚ÄúEr‚ÄìI was just checking out the playground,‚Äù Brother said.     ‚ÄúAnd no doubt you found out that Tuffy is a girl,‚Äù said Mama. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been discussing the situation and have pretty much decided that the best thing for Sister to do is simply to avoid his awful Tuffy person. Then, too, you‚Äôll be at school, and you can keep an eye on Sister. What do you think of the plan?      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù said Brother. ‚ÄúBut Sister‚Äôs the one that got beat up. What does she think?‚Äù     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I guess,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúBut what I‚Äôd really like to do is punch that Tuffy‚Äôs nose right through her face, then kick her in the shin, then knock her down and‚Äì‚Äú     ‚ÄúNow, Sister,‚Äù said Mama, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been through all that>‚Äù      Good! thought Brother. Sister and I are on the same wavelength.     Before dinner, Brother passed Sister a note. It said, Important! Meet me in the cellar at seven o‚Äôclock.‚Äù     The first thing Sister saw when she showed up for the secret meeting was one of Mama‚Äôs big bags of dried beans sitting on a stool. There was a drawing of a face marked Tuffy taped to it, and Brother was standing beside it holding the bag he had gotten at school. He also had a book. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù asked Sister.     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about that Tuffy character, and you not getting beat up again,‚Äù Brother said.      ‚ÄúSounds good so far,‚Äù said Sister.     ‚ÄúMama‚Äôs bag of beans is a punching bag,‚Äù Brother said.     ‚ÄúA punching bag named Tuffy,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúPerfect!‚Äù She gave the beans a pretty good punch.      ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù said Brother.      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the other bag?‚Äù Sister asked.     ‚ÄúBoxing gloves,‚Äù Brother said. ‚ÄúAnd this book is called The Art of Self-Defense>‚Äù     ‚ÄúWhere did you get all this stuff?‚Äù asked Sister.     ‚ÄúFrom Mr. Grizzmeyer. I told him I had a friend who was having trouble with a bully. We‚Äôve got it just for the weekend. It goes back Monday morning.‚Äù      ‚ÄúThen what are we waiting for?‚Äù Sister said. ‚ÄúLET‚ÄôS GET STARTED!‚Äù     Sister turned out to be a good student of the art of self-defense. With Brother‚Äôs help, she learned‚Äìthe left jab, the right cross, the left hook, and the upper cut. She also learned to duck. And she punched Mama‚Äôs dried beans silly.     ‚ÄúWell, you learned quite a lot over the weekend,‚Äù Brother said on Monday morning. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs something very important for you to remember: You still have to avoid Tuffy! She‚Äôs a mean little thing. She was even ready to take me on!‚Äù     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù said Sister. ‚ÄúI can still feel where she socked me on the jaw.‚Äù      Sister did a good job of avoiding Tuffy. She avoided her all day Monday and all day Tuesday.     But at recess on Wednesday, Tuffy did something so mean and nasty that Sister just had to do something. Tuffy was throwing stones at a baby bird that couldn‚Äôt fly yet! ‚ÄúStop that, you bully!‚Äù shouted Sister. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hurt that baby bird!‚Äù     ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt Little Miss Pink Hairbow!‚Äù said Tuffy. ‚ÄúYou know somethin‚Äô? I‚Äôd much rather hurt you!‚Äù     She rushed at Sister with her hard little fists ready.      But Sister was ready, too. She had her left out and her right up, protecting her jaw. When Tuffy threw a hard right, Sister ducked, then hit her square on the nose with a right cross.     THat quickly, Tuffy found herself sitting on the ground with a bloody noise.     And almost that quickly, one of the recess teachers swooped down on Sister and Tuffy, pulled them into school, and sat them on the principal‚Äôs discipline bench. Sister‚Äôs mind was a blurry mix of pride that she had protected the baby bird and shock that she was sitting on the principal‚Äôs famous discipline bench. But she was even more shocked when she saw that Tuffy was crying. ‚ÄúWhat are you crying abut? I only hit you once,‚Äù Sister said.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crying about that,‚Äù said Tuffy.     ‚ÄúThen what are you crying about?‚Äù Sister couldn‚Äôt help wondering what could make a cub as tough and mean as Tuffy cry.     ‚ÄúIf the principal tells my mom and dad about this,‚Äù said Tuffy, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be able to sit down for a‚Äìwell, a long time.‚Äù     Hmm, thought Sister. Here‚Äôs a cub who maybe gets hit a lot at home. Maybe that‚Äôs why she likes to hit other cubs at school. But Sister didn‚Äôt think about that for long.      She was too worried about what was going to happen to her. Mr. Honeycomb, the principal, was very strict about fighting.      The way it turned out, one of the other recess teachers had seen the whole thing and told Mr. Honeycomb that Sister was just trying to protect a baby bird. So Mr. Honeycomb let Sister off with a warning.     As for Tuffy, the principal didn‚Äôt call in her parents. But she did lose a week of recess, and she had to visit the school psychologist twice a week for quite a while.       tuffy BEANS tuffy BEANS tuffy BEANS Tuffy Tuffy Tuffy Tuffy MR HONEYCOMB PRINCIPLA                                                                                      \n"
